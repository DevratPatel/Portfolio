2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key

### Step 2: Add Environment Variable

   ```
3. Replace `your_actual_api_key_here` with your actual API key

### Step 3: Restart Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Sample Terminal Session

```
Portfolio Assistant Terminal v1.0.0
Type 'help' for available commands or ask me anything about Devrat's background.
Examples: 'tell me about your skills' or 'what projects have you worked on?'

❯ help
Available commands:
  help     - Show this help message
  clear    - Clear the terminal
  about    - About this portfolio

You can also ask me natural language questions about Devrat's:
  • Skills and technologies
  • Work experience
  • Projects
  • Education
  • Leadership roles

Examples:
  "What programming languages do you know?"
  "Tell me about your experience at IDIR"
  "What projects have you built?"

❯ what programming languages do you know?
I have experience with a wide range of programming languages including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Swift, Ruby, Golang, SQL, C, Java, C++, and C#. I'm particularly strong in full-stack development, with expertise in JavaScript and TypeScript for both frontend and backend development. I've used Python extensively for various projects and have experience with Swift for iOS development through my work with MOBI. My SQL knowledge comes from building database systems like the Arlington Organic Market inventory management system using PostgreSQL.

❯ tell me about PrintQ
PrintQ is one of my key projects where I built a real-time queue management app for UTA Libraries' Print & Design Studios. This project replaced manual processes and was built using Next.js, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. What made this project particularly valuable was the extensive user research I conducted at 6 UTA Libraries and other locations to study efficient queue workflows and system design. The app provides real-time queue management capabilities, helping streamline the printing process for students and staff at the university libraries.

## Error Handling

### If AI is Not Initialized

The terminal will show "(AI Offline)" and display error messages if:

- No API key is found
- API key is invalid
- Failed to initialize the AI service

### If Rate Limited

- The system will inform you when you've reached the rate limit
- Wait 1 minute before making more requests
- Rate limit resets every minute

### If API Key Doesn't Work

1. Verify the API key is correct and active
2. Check that you've enabled the Gemini API in Google AI Studio
3. Ensure the environment variable name is exactly `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY`
4. Restart the development server after adding the API key

### Common API Errors

- **404 Model Not Found**: The code now uses `gemini-1.5-flash` (updated from deprecated `gemini-pro`)
- **403 Forbidden**: Check your API key permissions in Google AI Studio
- **429 Too Many Requests**: Built-in rate limiting should prevent this, but wait if it occurs

## Security Notes

- API key is client-side (standard for free tier APIs)
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Strict prompt engineering ensures only resume-related responses
- AI responses are constrained to professional background only

## Customization

You can modify the terminal behavior by editing:

- `app/utils/chatbot.ts` - AI configuration and response logic
- `app/components/Terminal.tsx` - Terminal interface and commands

## Example Use Cases

- **Recruiters**: Interactive way to learn about skills and experience
- **Portfolio Visitors**: Engaging method to explore professional background
- **Networking**: Quick access to specific project or skill information
- **Interviews**: Demonstrate AI integration and technical capabilities

## Troubleshooting

- Check browser console for any errors
- Verify API key is set correctly in `.env.local`
- Ensure development server is restarted after adding API key
- Test with simple questions first like "what are your skills?"
- If you see "model not found" errors, the code has been updated to use `gemini-1.5-flash`

The AI terminal assistant provides an innovative way for visitors to interact with your portfolio and learn about your professional background through natural conversation!
